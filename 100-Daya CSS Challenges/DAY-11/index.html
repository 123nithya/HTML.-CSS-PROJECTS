    setInterval();
    We want our clock to move its hands every second, just like a real clock. We use a magic function called setInterval to do this. 
    It tells the computer to run a set of instructions over and over again, every second.

    let secs: We take the current seconds and multiply by 6. Why 6? Because a full circle is 360 degrees, and there are 60 seconds in a 
    minute. So, each second is 6 degrees (360 รท 60 = 6).

    let mins: Same as seconds, we multiply the minutes by 6.

    let hrs: We take the current hours and multiply by 30. There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour is 30 degrees (360 รท 12 = 30).

    hr.style.transform = rotateZ(${hrs + (min / 12)}deg); sets the rotation of the hour hand based on the current hours. The (min / 12) 
    part ensures the hour hand moves slightly every minute for a smoother transition.

    querySelector:
    A webpage is like a big puzzle made up of different pieces. These pieces are called elements, like headings, paragraphs, buttons, 
    and more. Each piece can have a special name or a label, like a class, so we can find it easily.When we use querySelector, we tell 
    the computer to look for an element with a specific label on the webpage.
